title: "Logbooks"

## Preamble

In principle there is no difference between scample from catch, logbooks and scientific surveys. They could hence for all practical purposes be all stored within the same schema and table structure.

What they all have in common is:

* Trip (cruise) table
* Station table
* Sample table
* Detail (biological) table

## The logbook data

The Fiskistofa logbook schema structure is a total mess.

### The new data

```{r, eval = FALSE}
tbl_mar(con, "adb.trip_v") |> 
    select(trip_id, 
           vid = vessel_no,
           T1 = departure,
           hid1 = departure_port_no,
           T2 = landing,
           hid2 = landing_port_no,
           source,
           everything())
```
