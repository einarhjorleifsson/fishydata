title: "Working with AIS data using {duckdb} and {h3}"
author: Einar Hj√∂rleifsson
description: "Must admit that I have not fully grasped the duckdb-concept but what I have explored is magical. The main R-package is {duckdb} but {duckdbfs} provides a nice wrapper for making connection to files easier (similar to the {arrow}) package. On top of it {duckdbfs} has some intriguing spatial function. Here a little exploration of the AIS data is made to put the feature to a test."

The steps:

* Open a duckdb connection to a sweep of AIS parquet files.
  * Datafiles contain all vessel pings from 2008-2024
* Filter the data, only pings of demersal fish bottom trawl, limit the extent to fishing in Icelandic waters.
* Convert coordinates to h3-index at resolution level 9. This means that each hexagonal grid is 0.105	$km^2$ (If this were a circle the diameter would be ~400 meters)
* Sum effort for each hex-grid for each year
* Above all done within duckdb, the data only imported into R the last step

This results in ~7.4 million records consisting of three variables (year, hex-grid index and effort), the time the whole processing takes is less 10 seconds!

We then use the 'add_h3' {mapdeck}-function to get a quick overview of the results, here only for year 2024.

```{r}

         between(lon, -30, -10),    # Icelandic area
         between(lat, -62.5, 68),
         between(speed, s1, s2),    # only towing speed
         between(time, t1, t2),     # start-end of tow
         .cid > 0,                  # not in harbour
         agf_gid == 6) |>           # bottom trawl
  mutate(h3id = h3_latlng_to_cell_string(lat, lon, zoom)) |> 
  group_by(year, h3id) |> 
  summarise(z = sum(dt, na.rm = TRUE),
            .groups = "drop") |>

mapdeck(location = c(-22, 66),
        zoom = 6,
        libraries = "h3") |> 
  add_h3(data = d |> filter(year == 2024) |> mutate(z = ifelse(z > quantile(z, 0.99), quantile(z, 0.99), z)),
         hexagon = "h3id",
         fill_colour = "z",
         palette = "inferno")
