description: "When it comes to commerical fisheries data, the Norwegians are quite liberal. Actually extremely liberal. They basically have everything accessible. Here a quick code hash is provided as a case in point, showing the longline fleet individual hauling operation in 2022 to 2024."

I am not going to provide much mumbo-jumbo text here, just some code and then a result. I may at some later stage write how one can retrieve these open data, here the focus is just on exposing the gold mine. What I did was:

* Get callsign of vessels that registered using hooks [Krokredskap] in 2024 in the captain logbook registry.
* Use the callsign list to filter out records from the AIS/VMS database for the years 2022-2024.
* Basically a dataset of vessels time, lon, lat and speed.
* Further restrict the dataset by adding a speed filter between 0.5-3.0, representing hauling speed.
* Plot the beauty.

Of course the devil is in the details, like false positives. But those for all practical purposes do not have a big impact on the overall signal.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(arrow)
library(here)
library(mapdeck)

# Get the call sign for vessel using hooks, used to filter the ais data downstream
#  here only use 2024 - just because I have only downloaded those data
CS <- 
  read_csv2(here("data-raw/fangstdata_2024.csv")) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
  filter(redskap_gruppe == "Krokredskap") |> 
  select(cs = radiokallesignal_seddel) |> 
  filter(!is.na(cs)) |> 
  pull(cs) |> 
  unique()
# connect to the full database (110 million records)
# only years 2022 to 2024, and only vessels (based on callsign) using hooks
# add a simple speed filter, associated with line hauling
ais <- 
  open_dataset(here("data/ais/norway")) |>
  filter(year %in% 2022:2024) |> 
  filter(cs %in% CS,
         between(speed, 0.5, 3.0))
# map the pings
ais |>
  select(cs, time, lon, lat, speed) |>
  # import data into R
  collect() |> 
  drop_na() |> 
  # some 1.9 million records
  mapdeck(zoom = 6, location = c(0, 60)) |> 
  add_scatterplot(fill_colour = "speed",
                  update_view = FALSE,
                  legend = FALSE,
                  radius = 300, layer_id = "points", 
                  palette = "inferno")
```


Now this is just gleaming the surface of what if feasible. We could, given the data at hand, allocate a kg catch for a specific species to each of these points given the logbook information.


Of course in practice we would when summarize the data across vessels and a specified time period (like one year).
